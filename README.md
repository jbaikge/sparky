# Sparky

Sparky is an experimental website CMS, with the goal of taking the place of
WordPress in the distant future.

## Install

```
go install github.com/jbaikge/sparky@latest
```

## Run

The default behavior is to run with a SQLite-backed database in the current
directory. MySQL/MariaDB is an alternative for a more production-based
environment.

```
sparky -dev
```
